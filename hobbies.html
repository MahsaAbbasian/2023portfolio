    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      my spare time I learn WEB DEVELOPMENT which my focus is on HTML, CSS, Java
      Script and React Since I like web development area. Recently I started to
      learn Phyton, and I believe that as a software engineer, I need to expand
      my knowledge in new areas which makes it possible to adapt changes in my
      project in future.

      Also, I like to read news in Turkish so, I can keep myself fresh with my
      language learning. I also like to listen to radio in Swedish to improve my
      Swedish language as well. Beside all this I enjoy my time traveling with
      my family and visiting friends as well.
